				<h1>Statement</h1>
				<p>My journey started in 2006 when I volunteered at an art event at my children&rsquo;s school. I discovered a whole new world and started painting at home as a hobby, sometimes completing only two or three pieces a year.</p>
				<p>After nine years, I finally decided to show my paintings to people beyond my friends and family. The positive reactions and feedback motivated me to create more.</p>

				<p>My passion is to depict continuous movement and vibrant colors in my paintings. As a native of Brittany in the western peninsula of France, the ocean and its changing colors inspire me; the sea was certainly my element in a previous life! </p>
 				<p>Painters who capture the aspect of light such as Gauguin fascinate me.</p>
				<p>I am a self-taught artist. My style is mostly art figuratif; I use acrylic and love working with textures, unmixed colors, and using a brush, sometimes a palette knife, to recreate silhouettes and landscapes, while also giving something to imagine and to dream. </br>
				I often start painting with an idea and end up with something very different because I don&rsquo;t try to stick to the reality but instead I put my own colors and emotions during the process. </p>

				<p>I try to keep the open-mindedness of children. </br>
				Children are imaginative and sensitive to the mystery and beauty of the world. </br>
