				<h1>About the artist</h1>
				<p>Anne Marie Pegolotti was born and raised in France, Quimper (Brittany).
				She studied in France in the University of Brest then in the University of Paris 10.
				She came in the USA (California) in 2000 with her husband and her 3 children.

				<h1>Statement</h1>
				<p>My journey started in 2006 when volunteering at an art event at my children&rsquo;s school. I discovered a whole new world and started painting at home as a hobby, sometimes only 2 or 3 pieces a year depending on time.</p>
				<p>That was 10 years ago. Last year, I decided to show my paintings to other people other than friends and family. The positive reactions and feedback motivated me to create more.</p>

				<p>My passion is to give movement and vibrant colors in my paintings. Being native of Brittany, the western peninsula of France, the ocean and its changing colors are a big part of my inspiration (the sea was certainly my element in a previous life!). </p>
 				<p>I have always been fascinated by painters like Gauguin, who was able to capture the aspect of light of this part of France.</p>
				<p>I&rsquo;m a self-taught artist. My style is mostly art figuratif; I use acrylic and love working with textures, unmixed colors, using a brush and sometimes a palette knife to recreate silhouettes and landscape but also to give something to imagine and to dream. </br>
				I often start painting with an idea and end up with something very different because I don&rsquo;t try to stick to the reality but instead I put my own colors and emotions during the process. </p>

				<p>I try to keep the open-mindedness of children. </br>
				Children are imaginative and sensitive to the mystery and beauty of the world. </br>
